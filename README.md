# login Form

I have build a simple login page . This web page uses Html, CSS , and a little JavaScript .

This login form takes User Name, e-mail id, and a set of password from user. If the the entered passwords does not Match it notifies the user about the same.

2. Then it takes input for UserName.
3. Then it takes input for E-mail id .
4. Then it asks for password.
5. after that it ask to enter the same password.
6. Then there is a login button.
7. Then there is a label asking if user a member . Along with it there is a link to sign-up.
8. At last there is a forgot password link . 
9. After user clicks login it also displays a label with login information.

## WorkFlow
